# UltimateDesktopCompanion Project Initialization

## Metadata
- **Date**: 2025-05-04
- **Status**: In Progress
- **Owner**: Orchestrator
- **Task ID**: INIT-001

## Project Overview
The UltimateDesktopCompanion is a comprehensive cross-platform system monitoring and media control suite that provides:

1. Real-time visualization dashboard for system metrics
2. Universal media controller hub
3. Lightweight background service with high performance
4. Advanced features for customization and automation
5. Enhanced user experience with accessibility features
6. Ecosystem integration with community marketplace

## Initialization Steps
1. Created project tracking structure (.roo/boomerang-state.json)
2. Initialized logging system
3. Created basic project directory structure:
   - src/ (with core/, dashboard/, media/, api/, utils/, ui/ subdirectories)
   - docs/
   - tests/
   - assets/
4. Created project README.md with overview and structure
5. Created first task for Architect mode (ARCH-001)

## Current Status
- Project structure initialized
- Task tracking system established
- First architecture design task created and assigned to Architect mode

## Next Steps
1. Await completion of high-level architecture design from Architect mode
2. Based on architecture design, create component implementation tasks
3. Establish development roadmap and priorities
4. Begin component implementation planning

## Notes
- Project requires careful resource management to meet performance targets (<1% CPU, <50MB RAM)
- Will utilize a WebSocket-based localhost server architecture
- Need to balance between system monitoring capabilities and media control features
- Architecture design will establish the foundation for all subsequent development work
