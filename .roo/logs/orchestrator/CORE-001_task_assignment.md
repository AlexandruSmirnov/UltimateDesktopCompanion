# Task Assignment: Core System Implementation

## Metadata
- **Date**: 2025-05-04
- **Status**: Assigned
- **Owner**: Orchestrator
- **Task ID**: CORE-001

## Task Overview
This task involves implementing the core system components of the UltimateDesktopCompanion according to the architecture design. The Core System is the foundation of the entire application, providing the essential services and infrastructure that all other components depend on.

## Assignment Details
- **Assigned To**: Code Mode
- **Priority**: High
- **Dependencies**: ARCH-001 (High-Level Architecture Design)
- **Due Date**: Not specified

## Task Requirements
The Code mode is tasked with implementing:

1. Service Orchestrator
2. Event Bus
3. Resource Manager
4. WebSocket Server
5. Plugin Manager (basic foundation)

## Expected Deliverables
- Source code for all core components
- Comprehensive unit and integration tests
- Documentation for all implemented components
- Performance metrics and optimization notes

## Assignment Process
1. Task created and documented in boomerang-state.json
2. Detailed task prompt created in tasks/CORE-001_core_system_implementation.md
3. Task assigned to Code mode

## Next Steps
1. Code mode to review task requirements
2. Code mode to implement the core system components
3. Code mode to return completed task to Orchestrator
4. Orchestrator to review and verify the implementation
5. Upon approval, proceed with the next component implementation

## Notes
- This is the first implementation task for the project
- The core system must meet strict performance requirements (<0.5% CPU, <25MB RAM)
- The implementation should follow the technology recommendations from the architecture design
- Special attention should be paid to the Event Bus as it is central to the system's communication
