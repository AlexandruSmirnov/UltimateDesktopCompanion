## Implementation Notes
The architecture design focused on balancing the performance requirements (<1% CPU, <50MB RAM footprint) with the extensive functionality required. The modular monolith approach was chosen to optimize resource sharing while maintaining clear component boundaries.

Key architectural decisions included:
- Using Electron as the application framework for cross-platform compatibility
- TypeScript as the primary language with Rust for performance-critical components
- Event-driven architecture for component communication
- Plugin-based extensibility with sandboxed execution
- WebSocket for real-time communication

## Next Steps
1. Review the architecture design with stakeholders
2. Create detailed component specifications
3. Develop proof-of-concept implementations for critical components
4. Establish development roadmap based on the architecture
5. Begin implementation of core components

## Conclusion
The architecture design provides a comprehensive blueprint for the UltimateDesktopCompanion system. It addresses all the requirements while considering performance, security, extensibility, and cross-platform compatibility. The design is flexible enough to accommodate future enhancements while providing clear guidance for implementation.
