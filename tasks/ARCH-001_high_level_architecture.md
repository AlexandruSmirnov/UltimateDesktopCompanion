# High-Level Architecture Design for UltimateDesktopCompanion

## Context
The UltimateDesktopCompanion is a comprehensive cross-platform system monitoring and media control suite that combines real-time system metrics visualization with universal media control capabilities. This project requires a carefully designed architecture that balances performance requirements (ultralight background service with <1% CPU, <50MB RAM footprint) with extensive functionality across multiple domains.

This is the initial architecture design task that will establish the foundation for all subsequent development work. The architecture must accommodate all the specified features while maintaining the performance characteristics and ensuring extensibility for future enhancements.

## Scope
Design a comprehensive architecture for the UltimateDesktopCompanion system that addresses:

1. **Core System Architecture**
   - Define the overall system architecture pattern (e.g., microservices, modular monolith)
   - Specify the communication mechanisms between components
   - Design the background service architecture with resource optimization
   - Establish the WebSocket-based localhost server architecture with security considerations
   - Define the data flow between system components

2. **System Monitoring Component**
   - Design the architecture for collecting system metrics (CPU, GPU, memory, network, storage, etc.)
   - Specify the data sampling and processing approach to maintain performance
   - Define the anomaly detection system architecture
   - Design the alerting and notification system

3. **Media Control Component**
   - Design the integration architecture for various media platforms
   - Specify the unified control interface architecture
   - Define the cross-application playlist management system
   - Design the audio routing and control architecture

4. **User Interface Architecture**
   - Define the UI framework and technology stack
   - Design the widget-based dashboard architecture
   - Specify the data visualization components and their integration
   - Design the theme system and accessibility features

5. **API and Extension System**
   - Design the REST and GraphQL API architecture
   - Specify the plugin system architecture
   - Define the SDK architecture for third-party integrations

6. **Cross-Platform Considerations**
   - Specify the approach for ensuring cross-platform compatibility
   - Define platform-specific components and abstractions

## Expected Output
Deliver a comprehensive architecture design document that includes:

1. **Architecture Overview**
   - High-level architecture diagram showing major components and their relationships
   - Description of the overall architecture pattern and rationale
   - Key architectural principles and constraints

2. **Component Architecture**
   - Detailed component diagrams for each major subsystem
   - Component responsibilities and interfaces
   - Data flow diagrams between components

3. **Technology Stack Recommendations**
   - Recommended technologies for each component
   - Justification for technology choices based on requirements
   - Evaluation of alternatives considered

4. **Performance Considerations**
   - Strategies for meeting the performance requirements
   - Resource optimization approaches
   - Scalability considerations

5. **Security Architecture**
   - Security model for the WebSocket server
   - End-to-end encryption approach
   - Zero-knowledge architecture design

6. **Extension and Plugin Architecture**
   - Detailed design of the extension system
   - API design principles and patterns
   - Plugin isolation and security model

The architecture document should be comprehensive, well-structured, and include appropriate diagrams to illustrate the design. It should provide sufficient detail to guide the implementation while allowing flexibility for refinement during development.
