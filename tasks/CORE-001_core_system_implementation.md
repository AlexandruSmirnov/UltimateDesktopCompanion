# Core System Implementation

## Context
The UltimateDesktopCompanion architecture design has been completed and verified. The system follows a modular monolith architecture with clear component boundaries. The Core System is the foundation of the entire application, providing the essential services and infrastructure that all other components depend on. This task focuses on implementing the core system components according to the architecture design.

The Core System must be implemented with strict attention to performance requirements (<1% CPU, <50MB RAM footprint) while providing a robust foundation for the rest of the application. The implementation should follow the technology recommendations from the architecture design, using TypeScript/JavaScript for most components with Rust for performance-critical parts.

## Scope
Implement the core system components of the UltimateDesktopCompanion according to the architecture design. This includes:

1. **Service Orchestrator**
   - Implement the startup and shutdown sequence
   - Develop the component lifecycle management
   - Create the dependency resolution system
   - Build the configuration management system

2. **Event Bus**
   - Implement the publish-subscribe mechanism
   - Develop the event routing system
   - Create the event prioritization system
   - Build the event persistence mechanism for critical events

3. **Resource Manager**
   - Implement the resource monitoring system
   - Develop the resource allocation strategies
   - Create the throttling mechanisms for resource-intensive operations
   - Build the adaptive resource management based on system load

4. **WebSocket Server**
   - Implement the WebSocket server for real-time communication
   - Develop the message protocol and serialization
   - Create the connection management system
   - Build the security layer with authentication and encryption

5. **Plugin Manager**
   - Implement the basic plugin loading mechanism
   - Develop the plugin validation system
   - Create the plugin isolation environment
   - Build the plugin API foundation

## Expected Output
Deliver a functioning core system implementation that includes:

1. **Source Code**
   - Well-structured and documented code for all core components
   - Comprehensive unit tests with high coverage
   - Integration tests for component interactions
   - Performance tests to validate resource usage

2. **Documentation**
   - Implementation details and design decisions
   - API documentation for all public interfaces
   - Usage examples and patterns
   - Performance characteristics and optimization notes

3. **Performance Metrics**
   - Baseline performance measurements
   - Resource usage statistics
   - Scalability characteristics
   - Optimization opportunities

The implementation should meet the following criteria:
- Core system runs with <0.5% CPU usage at idle
- Memory footprint <25MB (half of the total budget)
- All components properly communicate through the Event Bus
- WebSocket server handles at least 10 concurrent connections
- Resource Manager effectively controls resource usage

## Additional Resources
- Refer to the architecture design document (docs/architecture/system-architecture.md) for detailed component specifications
- Review the technology stack recommendations in the architecture design
- Consider the performance optimization strategies outlined in the architecture design
- Follow the coding standards and best practices established for the project
